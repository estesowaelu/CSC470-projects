Experiments to learn iOS, Objective-C, Ruby, and their respective SDKs. [AWS iOS SDK](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/), [AWS Ruby SDK](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/).

For CSC470: Cloud Computing at TCNJ, Spring 2013

iOS projects (1/3) require the AWSiOSSDK.framework to be in the base directory. (CSC470-projects/AWSiOSSDK.framework)

Ruby projects (4/5/6) require the aws-sdk gem to be installed.

This code is _not_ finished, merely functional. I hope/plan to return at some point and improve it.

In case you're curious, project 2 required the setup of a LAMP server on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu.
